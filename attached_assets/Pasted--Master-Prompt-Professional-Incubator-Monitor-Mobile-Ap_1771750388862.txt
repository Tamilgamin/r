🚀 Master Prompt: Professional Incubator Monitor Mobile App
Role: Act as a world-class Senior Mobile Engineer.
Task: Build a high-fidelity, production-ready React Native (Expo) mobile application for monitoring a chicken incubator via MQTT.

1. Technical Stack & Requirements
Framework: React Native with Expo (SDK 50+).

Communication: Use mqtt (specifically mqtt/dist/mqtt for RN compatibility).

Broker: Connect to HiveMQ Cloud (WSS) using:

Host: 57f9938c484c4f0f9ad4b79b70ae3bf7.s1.eu.hivemq.cloud

Port: 8884

Topic: incubator/temp

Libraries: lucide-react-native, expo-notifications, expo-av (for sound), react-native-svg.

2. Core Functionalities
Real-time Monitoring: Display live temperature data with a "Pulse" animation every time a new value arrives.

Smart Alarm System:

Adjustable High and Low temperature thresholds in the settings.

Master Alarm Toggle to enable/disable all alerts.

Sound Alert: Play a looping alarm sound when thresholds are breached.

Push Notifications: Send a local notification even if the app is in the background.

Auto-Mute: Alarm should automatically stop after a user-defined duration (seconds/minutes).

Robust Connectivity: Implement auto-reconnect logic. The UI must clearly show 3 states: Connected (Emerald), Reconnecting (Amber pulse), and Disconnected (Red).

3. UI/UX Design (The "Ditto" Look)
Theme: Dark Mode (Zinc-950 background).

Primary Accent: Emerald Green (#10b981).

Dashboard:

Large, thin-weight temperature display in the center.

A circular border that pulses when data updates.

Trend Indicators: Small "RISING" (Red) or "FALLING" (Blue) text with icons that appear only when the temperature changes.

Status badges showing "NORMAL", "HIGH", or "LOW" based on current thresholds.

Settings:

Clean, curved "Bento Box" style cards.

Numeric inputs for thresholds and alarm duration.

A "Test Alarm" button to verify sound and vibration.

4. Mobile Specifics
Permissions: Include NOTIFICATIONS, VIBRATE, and WAKE_LOCK in the configuration.

Background Mode: Ensure the MQTT client stays alive as long as possible in the background.

Animations: Use the Animated API for smooth transitions between the Monitor and Settings tabs.

Output Requirement: Provide the complete App.js, app.json with permissions, and the package.json dependencies. Ensure the code is clean, typed, and ready for eas build.
